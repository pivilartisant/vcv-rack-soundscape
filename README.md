 How to present a design experiment

1 Brief introduction
Déconstruction sonore is the fruit of what I can remember from the feeling and the sensation of being underwater. It is originally a reconstruction of this physical experience and memory with a modular synth emulator. 

2 Inspiration:
At the beginning I wasn’t really inspired by anything, I guess I just wanted to recreate this sense of calmness and stillness. After I started materialising my memory, I realised that this was not only about memory or a sensation… It was also about re-establishing an emotional connection. When looking into the semiotics of water, it is hard not to think of the emotional symbolism that it holds, and perhaps that one who seeks to recreate the sensation of being submerged in the sea's rhythm also seeks to re-create a missing link or bond with a lost loved one. 

2 List of materials required to do the experiment: 
VCV rack, field recording around quai de seine at La Bibliothèque Nationale de France. 

3 The setting:
In order to create the sound of water, you will need a white noise, a VCA controlled by an LFO or an ADSR, and a VCF for cutting low frequencies out in order to create a drone like effect. 

4 Experiments:
Following this method, the first experiment was to re-create the sounds of an underwater soundscape. After this successful creation, I decided to go forward and design an out of the water soundscape consisting of multiple waves in order to create the chaotic harmony of the sea. Finally, I tried to create an urban-aquatic soundscape, to try to determine if it was possible for me to recreate this sensation and ambient emotion with city field recordings. 


5 Results: 
I believe the first two experiments are successful and that the last one needs a little bit more work. Overall, I find it hard to perfectly imitate nature and that nothing will ever come close to the feelings and emotions associated with my memories.
